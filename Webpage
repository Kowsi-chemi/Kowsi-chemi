        <h2>Paragraph For Self Learning</h2>
        <p>
            Self-learning is a process where you teach yourself without a teacher. You find and study information alone.
            This method is popular because you can learn at your own speed. It’s like reading a book by yourself instead
            of in a group.
            <br>

            Self-learning has many benefits. You can study whenever you want. You can also choose what you want to
            learn. This flexibility makes it easier to learn new things. It also builds confidence because you’re in
            charge of your own learning.
            <br>

            Self-learning can be hard. It requires discipline and motivation. Without a teacher, you have to find and
            understand information yourself. This can be tough, but it also makes you a better learner.

            Technology helps with self-learning. The internet has many resources for learning. Websites and apps can
            teach you new things. You can also find online communities of other self-learners. They can help you
            when you’re stuck.
            <br>

            In conclusion, self-learning is a powerful tool. It can be challenging, but it’s also rewarding. With
            discipline and the right resources, anyone can be a successful self-learner.
